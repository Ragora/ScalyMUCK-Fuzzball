# ScalyMUCK-Fuzzball

This is the implementation of the Fuzzball modification for [ScalyMUCK](https://github.com/Ragora/ScalyMUCK) that
aims to mimic the old Fuzzball style command interfaces that older users would have grown acclimated to. It works
by implementing a message preprocessor system that catches the old Fuzzball command patterns and translates them
into the appropriate calls in the ScalyMUCK core.
